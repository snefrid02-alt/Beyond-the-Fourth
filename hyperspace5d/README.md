# HyperSpace5D - 5D Puzzle Platformer

A mind-bending puzzle platformer that takes place in **five spatial dimensions** (X, Y, Z, W, V). Inspired by Miegakure but with one additional spatial dimension, HyperSpace5D challenges players to navigate impossible geometries by rotating their view through different 3D slices of 5D space.

## Game Concept

In our 3D world, we can only perceive three spatial dimensions at once. HyperSpace5D extends this concept to **five dimensions**. As the player, you exist in full 5D space, but you can only see 3 dimensions at a time. By rotating your view to look at different 3D "slices" of the 5D world, objects appear, disappear, and paths emerge that seemed impossible moments ago.

### Core Mechanics

- **5D Movement**: Move through five spatial dimensions (X, Y, Z, W, V)
- **Dimension Rotation**: Rotate your view to see different 3D slices of the 5D world
- **Platforming**: Jump, dash, and wall-slide through impossible geometries
- **Puzzle Solving**: Use dimension rotation to reveal hidden platforms, bypass obstacles, and find paths to the goal

### Visual Feedback

Objects in the game provide visual cues about their position in 5D space:
- **Opacity**: Objects further away in hidden dimensions appear more transparent
- **Scale**: Objects shrink based on their distance in hidden dimensions
- **Color Tint**: Warm/cool colors indicate position in hidden dimensions (W and V)

## Installation & Dependencies

### For Arch Linux

Install all required dependencies using `yay`:

```bash
yay -S base-devel cmake gcc glm sdl2 glew imgui
```

### Dependency Details

- **base-devel**: Essential build tools (make, gcc, etc.)
- **cmake**: Build system generator (3.15+)
- **gcc**: C++ compiler with C++20 support
- **glm**: OpenGL Mathematics library for vector/matrix operations
- **sdl2**: Simple DirectMedia Layer for windowing and input
- **glew**: OpenGL Extension Wrangler for loading OpenGL extensions
- **imgui**: Immediate Mode GUI for debug interface

## Building the Game

### Standard Build

```bash
cd hyperspace5d
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
```

### Run the Game

```bash
./HyperSpace5D
```

The game will look for `shaders/` and `assets/` directories in the current working directory. Make sure to run from the build directory where these have been copied.

### Alternative: Out-of-Source Build

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ../hyperspace5d
make -j$(nproc)
./HyperSpace5D
```

## Controls

### Movement
- **W/A/S/D**: Move in the current 3D slice
- **Space**: Jump (can wall-jump when touching walls)
- **Left Shift**: Dash in the direction of movement

### Dimension Control

#### Quick Rotation
- **Q**: Rotate to XYW view (swap Z with W)
- **E**: Rotate to XYV view (swap Z with V)
- **R**: Return to XYZ view (standard 3D)

#### Direct Dimension Views (Number Keys)
- **1**: XYZ view (standard 3D space)
- **2**: XYW view (4th dimension W replaces Z)
- **3**: XYV view (5th dimension V replaces Z)
- **4**: XZW view
- **5**: XZV view
- **6**: YZW view
- **7**: YZV view
- **8**: XWV view
- **9**: YWV view
- **0**: ZWV view

### Level Navigation
- **ESC**: Restart current level
- **F1**: Previous level
- **F2**: Next level

### UI Controls
- **F3**: Toggle debug information panel
- **F4**: Toggle help/controls panel

## Levels

### Level 1: Introduction to 5D Space
Learn the basic mechanics of 5D movement and dimension rotation. Features a platform that only exists in certain dimensional views - you must rotate dimensions to see and reach it.

**Key Concept**: Objects can be invisible in one 3D slice but visible in another.

### Level 2: 5D Platforming
Master timing and precision with platforms that move through different dimensions. Platforms appear and disappear as they move through hidden dimensions.

**Key Concept**: Objects moving in hidden dimensions periodically intersect with your current view.

### Level 3: Hypercube Maze
Navigate a complex maze where walls exist in some dimensional views but not others. The path through the maze only makes sense when viewing the right combination of dimensions.

**Key Concept**: Strategic dimension rotation reveals different paths through the same space.

## Mathematical Explanation

### 5D Space Representation

A point in 5D space is represented by five coordinates: **(x, y, z, w, v)**

- **X, Y, Z**: Standard 3D spatial dimensions
- **W**: Fourth spatial dimension (perpendicular to X, Y, Z)
- **V**: Fifth spatial dimension (perpendicular to X, Y, Z, W)

### Dimension Projection

At any time, you view three of these five dimensions. The projection process:

1. **Apply 5D Rotation Matrix**: Orient the 5D space
2. **Extract 3 Visible Dimensions**: Select which 3 coordinates to display
3. **Calculate Hidden Depth**: Measure distance in the 2 hidden dimensions
4. **Apply Visual Effects**: Modify opacity, scale, and color based on hidden depth

### 5D Rotations

In 5D space, rotations occur in **2D planes** embedded in the 5D space. There are **10 possible rotation planes**:

- **3D planes**: XY, XZ, XW, XV, YZ, YW, YV, ZW, ZV, WV

A 5D rotation matrix is represented as a 5√ó5 matrix. Simple rotations in a single plane are defined by:

```
R(i,j,Œ∏) = rotation by angle Œ∏ in the plane spanned by axes i and j
```

The game uses these planar rotations to smoothly transition between different dimensional views.

### Collision Detection in 5D

Collision detection uses **5D Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABB)**. Two objects collide if they overlap in **all five dimensions** simultaneously:

```
For each dimension d ‚àà {X, Y, Z, W, V}:
    if (max‚ÇÅ[d] < min‚ÇÇ[d]) or (max‚ÇÇ[d] < min‚ÇÅ[d]):
        return NO_COLLISION
return COLLISION
```

This means an object can avoid collision by moving in dimensions you can't currently see!

## Save System

The game automatically saves your progress to `savegame.dat` in the current directory. This includes:
- Current level
- Highest level reached
- Total play time

## Building a Release Package

To create a distributable tar.gz archive:

```bash
./build.sh
```

This will:
1. Create a clean build
2. Compile the game
3. Package source code, assets, and documentation
4. Generate `hyperspace5d-1.0.0.tar.gz`

## Troubleshooting

### Shader Compilation Errors
- Ensure you're using OpenGL 4.5 or later
- Check that shader files are in the correct location (`shaders/` directory)
- Verify your GPU supports the required OpenGL version

### ImGui Not Found
- If ImGui headers aren't found, you may need to clone ImGui manually:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ocornut/imgui.git /tmp/imgui
sudo cp -r /tmp/imgui /usr/include/
```
- Then adjust `IMGUI_DIR` in CMakeLists.txt if needed

### Performance Issues
- Try reducing window resolution in the source code (SCREEN_WIDTH/SCREEN_HEIGHT)
- Disable VSync if needed (SDL_GL_SetSwapInterval(0))
- Check GPU drivers are up to date
